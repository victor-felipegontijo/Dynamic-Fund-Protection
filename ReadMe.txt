Project: Dynamic Fund Protection - Simulations and Pricing Methods
By: Victor Felipe Gontijo - Quantitative research intern - BNP Paribas - Paris
Proposed by: Jean-Philippe Lemor - Head of systematic strategies and hybrids quantitative research team - BNP Paribas - Paris
July 2020

The project is designed to be read and executed entirely through the Jupyter Notebook file: "Dynamic_Fund_Protection.ipynb". 

No other file needs to be directly executed, however, "Dynamic_Fund_Protection.ipynb", "Scenario1.png", "Protected_Portfolio.py", 
"Plot.py", "DFP_BSPricing.py" and, "CEV_Maxima.py" must be all placed in a same folder.

All functions used in the project are implemented in Python programming language.
Therefore, the Jupyter Notebook must be able to connect with a Python interpreter installed in the machine.

For any user who doesn't have Jupyter Notebook installed, we link a video explaining its installation for a Linux OS:

Windows users can have acces to this tool via Anaconda.
