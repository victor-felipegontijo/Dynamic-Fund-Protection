We intend, therefore, to properly define *Dynamic Fund Protections* as a financial product, to present the motivation around its most common uses and, to determine pricing methods for it. At a second moment, we intend to develop computational tools aimed to numerically determine prices for a *Dynamic Fund Protection* product, as well as, to its performance under different market outcomes."

    "In the present context, where individuals and instituitions get more and more access to information, they also tend to be increasingly concerned about their future, as well as, the choices they can make, to effectively plan it. In this perspective, financial planning has become a major issue in today's societies and, individuals and institutions are more and more encouraged to look for financial solutions that meet their particular needs, aspirations and future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finance is more than ever adressed with the problem to develop new custom-designed products, fucused on dealing with different kinds of risk, time horizons, and expected returns. The product we present here, the *Dynamic Fund Protection*, was first introduced by: *Gerber and Shiu (1998, 1999)*. It was initially conceived for portfolios based in units/shares of investment funds and, designed to provide protection against downwards moves affecting the value of those units/shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investiment funds have been, for a long while, a great alternative, when it comes to get exposition to financial investments. It makes investments much more accessible to general investors and, as a consequence, they reveal themselves as important means of collecting imense quantities of capital, which are immediately driven to reincorporate the economical activity and enhance the potential of the market. As an exemple, we may imagine the huge economical impact of the well-knowns american pension-funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment funds also serve as important tools to regroup several market actors that share the same investment strategies. It makes much easier and effective to track an index, or to invest in small-caps, for example. A fact is: each kind of fund has its own profile, which makes sometimes hard for a particular investor to find a fund meeting exactly his requirements. In order to provide a solution for this issue, many insurance and banking companies have been looking at those requirements and developing products that make them more achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's approach the \"retirement-problem\", in order to draw an example. This example will lead us to understand a context and a motivation for developing Dynamic Fund Protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "One looking to make financial plannings on his own retirement, is someone who considers to invest, in a long-term perspective, a small part of his periodic income, during the most part of his life. For sure, this person also expects those long-term returns to be certain and high enough to provide him, when he no longer intends to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "For many years, those in a such position would surely look for pension-funds with conservative characteristics. As interest rates have become low, however, such returns were no longer expected to be \"enough\" and people looking for retirement options started shifting to funds with more risky characteristics. Well, as a contrast, the expected returns became no longer \"certain\" as they were. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Dynamic Fund Protection is a financial product designed for someone who intends to limit his losses against downwards moves, that may eventually affect the value of his units, in some investment fund. More than this, the product is also designed to allow such a person to profit, at any time, from the appreciation on the value of his units.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about downside protection, it is very natural to think about Put Options. In the context of the example, European Put Options are even more natural to think, once people have usually a determined retirement date. Dynamic Fund Protection, as we may see, works as an extension of a European Put. As the payoff of such options are completely determined by the underlying's price at the maturity date, diferent underlying's paths, with equal prices at the maturity, will have exactly the same payoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the following evolution of prices of a ETF, tracking the *S&P 500* index. Let's analyse how good it would be for a person, if his retirement plan were based in units of this ETF and European Put Options on the *S&P 500*, with srike $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/Scenario1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently, neither would this person profit from his Put Option potential concerning downwards moves, nor would he profit from the market's great recovery. As we may see later, a porfolio with units of the correspondent ETF and a Dynamic Fund Protection is designed to be very performant in this scenario.\n",
